# Basic Go Blockchain

This is a simple, educational implementation of a blockchain built from scratch in Go. It demonstrates the core concepts of a blockchain, including blocks, chaining (using previous hashes), and a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining system.

This project is not intended for production use but serves as a clear, minimal example of how a blockchain's underlying data structure and mining process work.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

  * Go (Version 1.18 or newer)

### 1\. Initialize Your Go Module

In your project's directory, run this command to create a `go.mod` file:

```bash
go mod init my-blockchain
```

### 2\. Run the Program

Execute the `main.go` file. The program will create a new blockchain, mine a Genesis block, and then mine two more blocks containing sample data.

```bash
go run .
```

-----

## Example Output

You will see the program log its progress as it mines each block. Notice that each `Hash` starts with `0000` (the difficulty) and that `Block 1`'s `Prev. Hash` matches `Block 0`'s `Hash`.

```bash
$ go run .
2025/11/01 07:49:00 Creating a new blockchain...
2025/11/01 07:49:00 Blockchain created!
2025/11/01 07:49:00 Mining block 1 (Send 1 BTC to Alex)...
2025/11/01 07:49:01 Block 1 added.
2025/11/01 07:49:01 Mining block 2 (Send 2 BTC to Ben)...
2025/11/01 07:49:02 Block 2 added.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 1\. Block (`Block` struct)

A `Block` is the fundamental data structure. It contains:

  * **`Timestamp`**: When the block was created.
  * **`Data`**: The information stored in the block (e.g., transaction details).
  * **`PrevBlockHash`**: The hash of the previous block. This is what links the blocks into a chain.
  * **`Hash`**: The block's own unique hash, calculated from all its other data.
  * **`Nonce`**: A number used by the mining process.

### 2\. Blockchain (`Blockchain` struct)

The `Blockchain` is a simple `struct` that holds the list (slice) of all the `*Block` pointers and the `Difficulty` for the Proof-of-Work.

### 3\. Hashing (`calculateHash`)

A block's hash is its "fingerprint." It's a unique ID generated by combining all its data (Timestamp, Data, Previous Hash, and Nonce) and running it through the **SHA-256 algorithm**. Even a tiny change to any part of the block will result in a completely different hash, which is what makes the chain secure.

### 4\. Proof-of-Work (PoW) (`mineBlock`)

This is the "mining" process. To add a new block, a "miner" must find a special number called a **`Nonce`** (Number used once).

When the `Nonce` is combined with the block's other data and hashed, the resulting `Hash` must meet a certain condition. In our case, the `Hash` must start with a specific number of leading zeros (e.g., `0000...`).

The only way to find this `Nonce` is by guessing (brute force). The `mineBlock` function loops, incrementing the `Nonce` by 1 and re-hashing the block thousands of times per second until it finds a valid hash. This "work" is what secures the blockchain and makes it difficult to tamper with.
